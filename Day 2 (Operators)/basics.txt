*Types of operators :
1.Arithmetic Operators ( Binary, Unary)
2.Relational Operators
3.Logical Operators
4.Bitwise Operators
5.Assignment Operators


##Arithmetic Operators:
Binary : +,-,*,/,%
Unary : ++, --

++a  = pre increment (first value change,then value use)
a++ = post increment (first value use,then value change)


##Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=


##Logical Operators:
&& (logical AND) = both condition must be true
|| (logical OR) = only one condition true needed
! (Logical NOT) = true will be false and false will be true


##Assignment Operators: =,+=,-=,*=,/=
